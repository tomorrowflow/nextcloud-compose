# Nextcloud Docker Compose Installation with Traefik

## Objective
Create an almost automated installation of Nextcloud using Docker Compose and Traefik as a reverse proxy. The installation should be guided by an interactive bash script that collects necessary information from the user and stores it in a `.env` file.

## Key Components
1. **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates Nextcloud, MySQL, and Redis services.
2. **Traefik**: Acts as a reverse proxy for Nextcloud.
3. **Interactive Bash Script**: Guides the user through the installation process.

## Reference Documents
1. [Nextcloud Admin Manual](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/31/admin_manual/index.html)
2. [Simple Homelab - Traefik Docker Nextcloud](https://www.simplehomelab.com/traefik-docker-nextcloud/)
3. [Simple Homelab - Traefik 2 Docker Tutorial](https://www.simplehomelab.com/traefik-2-docker-tutorial/)

## Implementation Strategy
1. Create Docker Compose configuration files.
2. Set up Traefik configuration.
3. Develop an interactive bash script to collect user input and generate the `.env` file.
4. Test the installation process.
